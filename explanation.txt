The code works by accumulating the readings of the Laser Scanner for n iterations (parameter),
it then converts to the euclidean space the meaurements and clusters using
a simple clustering algorithm, that chooses to either to merge to one of the clusters
or to create a new centroid, based on the distance from the centroids present at that instant.

The algorithm is able to detect multiple people but the only assumption is for the minimum distance 
between them, in case of many people the thresold of the clustering needs to be lowered,
otherwise some people might end up merged together.

Since the algorithm doesn't care of the concept of right/left feet, it is able
to deal with the case of people standing in lateral positions 
(lower number of subsequent meaurements).
